			echo '<h2>Airline Query - C</h2>';
			echo '<p>This was a school project for my second Comp Sci class in which I had to take an Excel sheet filled with airline information and make a program that allowed users to search for the flight paths, as well as a plethora of airlines. It\'s where I learned about the importance of commenting, because a big challenge was managing my opening and closing brackets.</p>';

			echo '<h2>Item Cart Simulation - Bash</h2>
			<p>This was a CRUD Application in Bash that simulated a shopping cart users could interact with by typing commands in the command line. It\'s a pretty simple idea, but this was my first exposure to any other programming language that wasn\'t Java or C.</p>';
