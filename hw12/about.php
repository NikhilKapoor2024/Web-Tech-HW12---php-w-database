				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born on July 3rd, 2001 in some city in California (I can\'t really remember anything before I was four years old). After moving to Texas when I was five years old, my older sister kept the house and has been living there ever since. From there, I attended elementary school, where I was very rambuntous and always ended up in the principals office at every grade level until the fifth grade. During that time, I began a habit of doodling in my journal when taking notes during class and created small newspaper strip comics with stick figures.

				echo '&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle school is where I got into video games and computers. Although, to say that I <q>got into computers</q> woudl be somewhat innacurate; I only was interested in usign computers to make videos using editing software like Adobe Premiere and After Effects. I had a YouTube channel I would run with my brother, but we haven\'t touched it since we started high school. I only took one tech class during my last year there, and that was Principles of Computer Science, with us learning HTML and Dreamweaver (kinda like how I\'m taking this class right now!).</p>';

				echo '&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High school was a weirdly interesting time for me. I made some friends, but I haven\'t exactly talked to them since graduating. During high school, I got into broadcast journalism, but I sadly never did anything like it after sophmore year. I was okay at it, but I liked going to locations and shooting footage rather than talking and being an anchor, so to speak. It was...really selfish of me to think of it like that, in hindsight. I learned a lot of lessons back then, and came to realize that when people say <q>high school doesn\'t matter</q>, they mostly mean that what you\'re probably worrying about in high school doesn\'t matter compared to the other stuff you\'ll worry about in university/college. When I became a freshmen in 2019, I quickly realized this as I suddenly had to deal with tuition, student loans, internships, and just the general horrors of growing up I tried blocking out since I was in the fifth grade.';

				echo '&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The COVID-19 Pandemic hit about halfaway into my Spring 2020 semester. Having to use the Virtual Desktop to work on assignments for my CS classes was an absolute slogfest; lag time was unbearable. Once I heard about the CS VPN, I immediately jumped ship to that and have never used the VM since. I learned Java, C, and then back to Java, and then learned bash and Python on top of relearning C, and then finally got back around to learning Java for JavaFX. It\'s been quite a ride, and there have been moments where I was frustrated when my programs weren\'t working because of an undetectable error and the fact that my wrists were hurting from all the typing didn\'t help much with the pain.';

I\'ve had a lot of great teachers along the way that have helped me understand subjects I was confused on, like how different programming languages do different things (adjusting to Java after C was a tough one, let me tell you). I\'m pretty confindent in my skills and I can\'t wait to learn more about HTML and how websites work.';
